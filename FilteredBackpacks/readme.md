# Filtered Backpacks
This mod adds new backpacks with higher capacity but restricted usage just like base game mining bag.
Restrictions are fully configurable on the server side, including which storage flag is used for a given category.

- **Mining bag:** A replacement for base game mining bag which is removed from the game.
- Simple and sturdy variants: 12/18 inventory capacity; crafting difficulty is on a similar level like the base game.
